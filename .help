Constructed Language Dictionary

Manage and organize words and definitions for your constructed language.

The dictionary, containing words and their corresponding definitions, is stored
as a JSON file call 'dict.json' in the root directory of the program. If no
dictionary is found, an empty JSON file will be created. DELETION OF THIS JSON
FILE WILL RESULT IN THE DELETION OF THE DICTIONARY.

Each definition is given an ID unique only the word it defines. There is no
guarantee for each ID to be unique across the entire dictionary.
